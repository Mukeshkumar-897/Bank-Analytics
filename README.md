### Bank Data Analytics Project: Optimizing Lending and Portfolio Management 

In this project, I undertook the task of analyzing banking data to enhance loan processing accuracy and strategic decision-making. Using SQL as the primary tool for data extraction and manipulation, I developed an in-depth report that examined lending patterns, risk assessments, and borrower financial health. By integrating and analyzing data from multiple sources, the report provided actionable insights into high-risk segments and key financial indicators of borrowers. These insights were instrumental in improving the accuracy of loan approval processes and reducing the likelihood of defaults. The comprehensive nature of the analysis ensured that lending decisions were data-driven and aligned with the bank’s risk management objectives.

To support long-term strategic planning, I provided month-over-month insights into loan trends. These insights highlighted patterns in loan applications, approvals, and repayments, enabling the bank to adjust its lending strategies proactively. The analysis helped the bank identify seasonal trends, high-performing loan types, and demographic factors influencing borrowing behavior. This forward-looking approach allowed for better allocation of resources and improved customer targeting, ensuring that the bank remained competitive in a dynamic market environment.

Additionally, I designed a Power BI dashboard to provide real-time visualization of critical metrics, such as loan types, amounts, and statuses. The dashboard offered an interactive platform for stakeholders to track portfolio performance and identify areas requiring immediate attention. By automating the visualization process, the dashboard significantly reduced the time spent on manual analysis and reporting. This enhancement not only improved operational efficiency but also empowered decision-makers with a clear and accurate overview of the bank’s lending portfolio. The combination of SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel in this project demonstrated my ability to handle complex data sets, deliver actionable insights, and contribute to the bank's strategic goals.
